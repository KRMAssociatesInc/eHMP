The eHMP project within the Veterans Health Information Systems and
"BLD",9895,1,2,0)
Technology (VistA) Evolution program will introduce expanded
"BLD",9895,1,3,0)
capabilities and modernize existing features of the VA VistA Electronic
"BLD",9895,1,4,0)
Health Record (EHR) system. The eHMP project is a multi-year effort to
"BLD",9895,1,5,0)
evolve a modern, service-oriented Enterprise Health Application
"BLD",9895,1,6,0)
Platform. This platform includes VistA Exchange, the eHMP Clinical
"BLD",9895,1,7,0)
Practice Environment (CPE), as well as clinical knowledge enrichment and
"BLD",9895,1,8,0)
decision support services. VistA Exchange is the clinical data services
"BLD",9895,1,9,0)
engine, federating clinical data from a variety of VA and DoD sources
"BLD",9895,1,10,0)
into an Enterprise Virtual Patient Record (eVPR). The eHMP CPE framework
"BLD",9895,1,11,0)
will incorporate capabilities currently provided by JLV and hi2 HMP.
"BLD",9895,1,12,0)
eHMP CPE will eventually replace the Computerized Patient Record System
"BLD",9895,1,13,0)
(CPRS) as VA?s primary point of care application. eHMP version 1.1
"BLD",9895,1,14,0)
Viewer Edition is the initial product supporting a user interface.
"BLD",9895,1,15,0)
This project is being deployed in phases with each new iteration 
"BLD",9895,1,16,0)
adding new features.

Technology (VistA) Evolution program will introduce expanded
"PKG",224,22,1,1,3,0)
capabilities and modernize existing features of the VA VistA Electronic
"PKG",224,22,1,1,4,0)
Health Record (EHR) system. The eHMP project is a multi-year effort to
"PKG",224,22,1,1,5,0)
evolve a modern, service-oriented Enterprise Health Application
"PKG",224,22,1,1,6,0)
Platform. This platform includes VistA Exchange, the eHMP Clinical
"PKG",224,22,1,1,7,0)
Practice Environment (CPE), as well as clinical knowledge enrichment and
"PKG",224,22,1,1,8,0)
decision support services. VistA Exchange is the clinical data services
"PKG",224,22,1,1,9,0)
engine, federating clinical data from a variety of VA and DoD sources
"PKG",224,22,1,1,10,0)
into an Enterprise Virtual Patient Record (eVPR). The eHMP CPE framework
"PKG",224,22,1,1,11,0)
will incorporate capabilities currently provided by JLV and hi2 HMP.
"PKG",224,22,1,1,12,0)
eHMP CPE will eventually replace the Computerized Patient Record System
"PKG",224,22,1,1,13,0)
(CPRS) as VA?s primary point of care application. eHMP version 1.1
"PKG",224,22,1,1,14,0)
Viewer Edition is the initial product supporting a user interface.
"PKG",224,22,1,1,15,0)
This project is being deployed in phases with each new iteration 
"PKG",224,22,1,1,16,0)
adding new features.
