The rate of decline in lung function is slower among persons who quit \r\nusing Tobacco. \r\n - Reduces the risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), \r\none of the leading causes of death in the United States. \r\n - Women who quit using tobacco during their reproductive years  reduce the risk \r\nfor infertility.

Tobacco use is expensive. \r\n\r\n Source: http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco \r\n If you use tobacco and decide to quit, we recommend you take  these steps: \r\n 1.
